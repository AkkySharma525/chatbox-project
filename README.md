# Chatbox Project

This is a simple real-time chat application where users can chat with an admin. The project includes two separate interfaces:

- **User Interface**: For users to send and receive messages.
- **Admin Interface**: For admins to receive and respond to messages from users.

The project utilizes **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Socket.io** for real-time communication.

## Features

- Real-time chat functionality using **Socket.io**.
- Separate interfaces for users and admins.
- Users can send messages to admins, and admins can reply.
- The chat messages are broadcasted and received by all users in real-time.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime to build the backend.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js to handle HTTP requests and serve static files.
- **Socket.io**: For enabling real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and server.
- **HTML/CSS**: For creating the frontend structure and styles.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity to the chat functionality.

## Future Goals

- **Save Chats in Memory**: The plan is to implement a feature to save chats in memory so that both admins and users can review past conversations.
- **Separate Chat Sections**: Create different chat sections for each user, ensuring that no user can view another user's chats.
- **Unique User IDs**: Use a database to assign unique IDs to each user, improving the chat system's management and data security.
- **Database Integration**: Implement a database for persistent storage of messages and user information.
